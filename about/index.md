**BladeRunnerJS** (BRJS) is a lightweight JavaScript framework and toolkit created by Caplin Systems to help you develop, test and deploy complex web applications. In particular, it supports simultaneous development by multiple teams of very large JavaScript codebases with numerous components. It does this by providing powerful workflows based on software engineering principles.

## Open Sourcing

We’re open-sourcing BladeRunnerJS because, although there are a number of great developer toolkits and frameworks available (like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [Mimosa](http://mimosajs.com/)), BRJS is unique in its approach and its support for [programming in the large](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small).

BRJS was originally created to make it easier to build extremely complex high-end financial trading apps in HTML5, and it has had a major impact on developer productivity for us and our customers. As the number of developers creating large-scale front-end web apps increases, we hope that BRJS will turn out to be useful to others. We’re also keen to validate our hunch that it will be equally valuable for building complex applications in other domains.

BladeRunnerJS is presently tightly coupled with the product we build with it. We're in the process of decoupling. As soon as that is complete the code will be available on github.

## More coming soon...

We're busy doing the work we need to do to open source it. But we'll share more information about why we created BRJS and the concepts it uses over time.
