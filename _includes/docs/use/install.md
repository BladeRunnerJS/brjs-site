## Prerequisites

In order to run BRJS you'll need [JRE 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jre-7-download-432155.html) installed. To deploy the built .WAR file you'll need access to an installation of [Apache Tomcat 6.x](http://tomcat.apache.org/) (installing is as simple as download and unzip).

## Download & Install BRJS

Download the [latest BRJS release](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases/) and unzip it somewhere. We'll now refer to that unzipped location as `BRJS_HOME`. The BRJS CLI excutable is `BRJS_HOME/sdk/brjs`.

    We're working towards a <a href="https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/issues/1">global install</a>. For the moment you'll need to execute the <code>brjs</code> command via <code>BRJS_HOME/sdk/brjs</code>.
