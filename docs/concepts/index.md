The purpose of the concepts section is to provide enough basic detail for somebody to answer the following questions:

* What is it?
* Why would I need it?
* How do I use it?

The contents of the *How do I use it?* parts of the concept docs won't go into too much detail. In-depth information will be found in and appropriate User Guide or Tutorial.
