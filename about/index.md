**BladeRunnerJS** (BRJS) is a developer toolkit and lightweight JavaScript framework developed by Caplin Systems. It helps you develop, build, test and deliver complex web applications. In particular, it supports simultaneous development by multiple teams of very large JavaScript codebases with numerous components. It does this by providing powerful workflows based on software engineering principles.

## Open Sourcing

Weâ€™re open-sourcing BladeRunnerJS because, although there are a number of great developer toolkits and frameworks available (like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [Mimosa](http://mimosajs.com/)), BRJS is unique in its approach and its support for [programming in the large](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_in_the_large_and_programming_in_the_small).

BRJS has significantly improved the developer productivity for both us and our customers when developing, testing, building and deploying applications. We hope that by open sourcing BRJS it will be useful to others who are building similarly complex applications in, or for, complex organisations. We're also very interested to see if it is useful outside of these organisations, building different types of applications.

BladeRunnerJS is presently tightly coupled with the product we build with it. We're in the process of decoupling. As soon as that is complete the code will be available on github.

## More coming soon...

We're busy doing the work we need to do to open source it. But we'll share more information about why we created BRJS and the concepts it uses over time.
