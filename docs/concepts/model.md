title: The BladeRunnerJS Model

The BladeRunnerJS model is at the core of the BladeRunnerJS logic. The model provides an abstraction away from files on the disk and provides rich access to the components and Source Modules within an App.

The model also provides extension points for plugins. New commands, bundlers and file type support can be easily added and hooked into the existing logic to handle dependencies and serve content.
