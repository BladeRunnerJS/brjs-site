**Presenter** is a JavaScript-based MVVM framework that you can use for creating the user interfaces. It's based around the [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) library, but has been modified to work in a way specific to BRJS.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>Knockout 3.0 is more extensible than Knockout 2.x and we plan to <a href="https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/issues/106">investigate how we can make Presenter extend Knockout 3.x</a>, rather than requiring a modified version of the 2.x library.</p>
