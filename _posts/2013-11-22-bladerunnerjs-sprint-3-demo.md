## What have these guys been doing for the past 2 weeks?

We've fixed a few bugs including an issue with filepaths containing spaces on Windows. However, the large part of the development focus has been on the [Bundler Plugin architecture](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/wiki/Bundling-Strawman).

One of our goals is to make BladeRunnerJS as plugin-friendly as possible, we want to make it easy for developers to write custom value-add plugins on top of BladeRunnerJS.

In addition to the above, we've also put out a blog post about one of our micro-libraries, [Topiarist](http://bladerunnerjs.org/blog/topiarist) - A JavaScript OO library featuring mixins, interfaces & multiple inheritence (complete with picture of darth vader trimming a shrub).

We also had Phil Leggeter attend [DunDDD](http://dun.dddscotland.com/) conference to give a talk on [Scaling JS Applications](http://leggetter.github.io/talks/scaling-js-apps/#/) which was well received.

## So what are we working on next?

Following our recent [BRJS v0.3 release](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases/tag/v0.3), we are moving closer to support for Node.js style client-side code and improving the user debugging experience.

For further details please see our [roadmap](http://bladerunnerjs.org/docs/roadmap/).
