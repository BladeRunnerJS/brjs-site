## HtmlResourceService
The HtmlResourceService performs an asynchronous HTTP request and retrieves the HTML bundle file from the app-server. 
When HTML is requested from the service, a DOM element is returned.  It is important that you do not make direct changes to the returned DOM element.
Rather, make a copy of it, and make any necessary alterations to the copy. Changes to the original will interfere with other code that requests the same DOM element. 
The HTML service translates any embedded internationalisation tokens.

## XMLResourceService
Similar to the HtmlResourceService the he XmlResourceService performs an asynchronous HTTP request, and retrieves the XML bundle file from the app-server. 
It parses the XML and makes the resulting XML document objects available on request. If you are using JSON based configuration you will not need to use this service.

## AppVersionService
Provides access to the unique version number of the app which is generated by the server. In a production environment this will be a timestamp from when the deployed artifact was generated. 
In development it will be the string <em>"dev"</em>. 

## LocaleService
Allows you to retrieve and set the locale being used. 

## BundlePathService
Allows access to the bundle paths used by the server. Allows you to construct URL to access static resource.
