**Workbench Tools** are pieces of functionality that help you develop and test a [blade](/docs/concepts/blades) as part of the developer workflow. They reside within a [Workbench](/docs/concepts/workbenches), normally have some UI representation within the Workbench and allow you to interact with the Blade through stubbed [services](/docs/concepts/services) and via the [EventHub](/docs/concepts/event_hub). For example you can view your Blade in different states by sending it mock events via a mock events Workbench Widget.

The default Workbench Tools are:

* EventHub logger
* KnockoutJS View Model Visualisation
