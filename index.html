      <p class="overview">
        BladeRunnerJS is a development toolkit and lightweight framework for building web applications consisting of one or more components called <strong>Blades</strong>. It comes complete with some <em>seriously</em> useful tools which make it easy to develop, test and deploy your app.

        <h2 title="Componentized Development">Components</h2>
        <p>An application built with BladeRunnerJS consists of one or more <strong>Blades</strong>. Each Blade can be made up of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other assets.</p>
        <p>Blades can be run in isolation during development making them easy to build, debug and test. Inter-blade communication is achieved via an event-hub.
        </p>

        <h2 title="Developer Tools for your Blades">Developer Tools</h2>
        <p><strong>Workbenches</strong> allow Blades to be developed, debugged and run independently of the app.</p>
        <p>Workbench Widgets allow you to interact with the Blade through stubbed services and via the event-hub. For example you can view your Blade in different states by sending it mock events via a mock events Workbench Widget.</p>

        <h2>Clean Code</h2>
        <p>Code is organized cleanly using <strong>classes</strong>, with one class per file, and JavaScript <strong>interface</strong> support is provided to help with creating large scalable code-bases.</p>
        <p>Services are a first-class concept that allow your application to be written before the back-end is finished, and can be replaced by mocks in your tests.</p>
