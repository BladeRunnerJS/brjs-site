**BladeSets** are an application structure BRJS concept. They represent a collection of [blades](/docs/concepts/blades) that share some common code. They can also share assets such as styles, HTML templates and images. This allows you to create logical groupings of blades that display information in a consistent way. For instance: you would use a bladeset to share the custom code for numerical formatting in a set of blades, or to house a common date-chooser configuration.
