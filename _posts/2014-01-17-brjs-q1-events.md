Over the next few months members of the BladeRunnerJS team are going to be at a few events to talk about BladeRunnerJS, the concepts behind it, development in general and open sourcing.

### FOSDEM, Brussels, 1 - 2 February

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/) is an open source software community event with 5000+ attendees. I'll be giving a talk on [Building front-end JavaScript apps that scale](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/event/javascript_app_scalable/) in the [JavaScript room](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/javascript/). With talk titles like "Beyond the To-do List" and "JavaScript for enterprise" I'm really looking forward to seeing the other talks too.

FOSDEM is in Brussels and entry is **absolutely free**. So, if you're based in Brussels, nearby, or further afield and fancy a trip, then I'd suggest taking a look at the amazing [schedule](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/). I'm sure it'll convince you that it's worth attending.

### QCon, London, 5 - 7 March

We've decided to sponsor [QCon London](http://qconlondon.com/london-2014/) so I'll be giving a talk in the solutions track and we'll have an exhition table (likely on the 5th floor). This means we'll be organising some swag for the event; t-shirts, stickers and USB drives.

If you're going to be at QCon, please head over to our stand and attend our talk. And don't hesitate to [drop us a tweet](https://twitter.com/BladeRunnerJS) if you'd like to plan ahead, or have any better ideas for swag!

### Fluent, San Francisco, 11 - 13 March

<img src="/blog/img/fluent-2014.png" align="right" style="margin:20px;" />
[Fluent](http://fluentconf.com/fluent2014) is one of the biggest JavaScript events of the year, so we had to attend. And with this years focus being "The Web Plaform" - including topics like tools, platforms, APIs and front-end libraries - we really wanted to give a talk too. So we'll be there.

If you are going to be at Fluent, or just in the San Francisco area from March 11 - 13 and would like to meet up please [get in touch](mailto:bladerunnerjs@caplin.com).
