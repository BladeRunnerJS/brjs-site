The browser support for applications created using BladeRunnerJS (BRJS) depends on the libraries that are used within the application.

The default set of libraries that BRJS includes (micro libraries such as module loader, fell, emitr and topiarist, and core BRJS libraries) provide support for all HTML5 capable browsers and IE8+.
