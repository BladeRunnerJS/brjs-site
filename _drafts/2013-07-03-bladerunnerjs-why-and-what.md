The first blog post about a service or product tends to answer the question "What is it?". I understand why that's the first question. But, the more interesting and important question about [BladeRunnerJS](http://bladerunnerjs.org) is the **Why** - "Why does it exist?". So, I'm going to start by answering that question.

There's no getting around the fact that we started with a number of requirements. And it's a good starting point, because it means we built BladeRunnerJS to meet real-world requirements.
