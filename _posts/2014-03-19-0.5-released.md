## IE8 Support
We've made changes to our br-bootstrap library's dependencies so that it also now includes shims for IE8. These include `html5shiv`, `es5-shim` and `normalize`.

## Improved stability of running tests on Windows
In our [previous v0.4 release](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases/tag/v0.4) we had a known issue related to a Java 7 bug that caused the JVM to crash on Windows due to a race condition when closing/cancelling File Watchers. 

This bug is still [open](http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8029516) with Oracle at the moment, but in the interim we've got a temporary workaround which is to not `cancel()` or `close()` the File Watchers on Windows and let the process terminate them when it ends.

## New Dependency Analysis commands
Want to better understand why a class is being bundled as a dependency? Or even just to understand the dependencies of your application in a tree graph? This one's for you!

#### Commands
```
* app-deps <app> [<aspect>] [-A|--all]
* workbench-deps <app> <bladeset> <blade>
* dep-insight <app> <require-path> [<aspect>] [-p|--prefix] [-a|--alias] [-A|--all]
```

#### Example output
```
$ ./brjs app-deps myApp

Aspect 'default' dependencies found:
    +--- 'default-aspect/index.html' (seed file)
    |    \--- 'myApp/Class1'
    |    |    +--- 'myApp/Class2'
    +--- 'resources/xml/config.xml' (seed file)
    |    \--- 'myApp/Class1' (*)

    (*) - dependencies omitted (listed previously)
```

For further details on these commands, see our wiki page for [debugging your application dependencies](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/wiki/Debugging-your-application-dependencies).
