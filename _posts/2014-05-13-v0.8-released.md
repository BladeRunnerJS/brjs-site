It's been a busy two weeks. First we had [FutureJS](http://futurejs.org) in Barcelona where we
ran a work workshop and gave a talk on **How to Build Front-End Web Apps that Scale**.
Then we were exhibiting at [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com) and also spoke about our experiences of
**Testing Ginormous JavaScript Apps**. Finally, we've release BRJS v0.8. As we said,
a busy two weeks!

## FutureJS - Workshop

![](/blog/img/future-js-workshop.jpg)

In the [Open Sourcing Stats blog post](http://bladerunnerjs.org/blog/open-sourcing-stats/)
we stated that running workshops was a great way for us to get feedback and
that our first one was going to be at FutureJS. Well, our first **How to Build Front-End
Web Apps that Scale** workshop was a success.

<a name="futurejs-workshop-feedback"></a>
The workshop was sold out with 20 attendees and the feedback we've got so far has
been very positive.

<small>We used <a href="http://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a>, who were FutureJS
sponsors, to capture the results</small>

We've published the [Workshop Exercises](http://bladerunnerjs.github.io/scaling-js-apps)
so in theory you could work through them - if you try to do so any need any help
please [get in touch](/support/) as it's likely it'll be missing a few things we directly provided
when running it in person.

**If you're interested in us coming to your event or company and running the workshop
please [get in touch](/support/).**

The next planned run through of the [workshop in San Francisco at ForwardJS](http://forwardjs.com/training-sessions/#goto-204). If
you'll be in SF on 24th July 2014 hopefully you'll be able to make it!

## FutureJS - Talk

At [FutureJS](http://futurejs.org) we gave a general talk on **How to Build Front-
End Web Apps that Scale** - we weren't expecting to be speaking, but were asked if
we could after another speaker dropped out. A great opportunity, not to be missed!

We've given similar talks elsewhere, but the talk content continues to change as
we discover what resonates most with attendees and continue to learn strategies
and practices for building large scale front-end web apps. This version of the talk
was very general and didn't talk specifically about BladeRunnerJS. We'll be sure
to post a link to the video once it's published but for now you can view the
[How to Build Front-End Web Apps that Scale - FutureJS](http://www.slideshare.net/leggetter/how-to-build-frontend-web-apps-that-scale-futurejs)
slides on slideshare.

One of the highlights
for us was that, although we're convinced that what we do is
applicable outside of building large financial HTML5 web trading apps, we need to
prove this. So, it was great when [Pete Hunt](https://twitter.com/floydophone), who's currently heading up the web
engineering team at Instagram, tweeted at us and then later headed over to chat
about how Facebook are solving similar problems with their web front-end.

With two of the [BladeRunnerJS Team](/about/team) based in Scotland we wanted to
get involved at [ScotlandJS](http://scotlandjs.com).

So, as well as sponsoring
and taking a booth we submitted a talk as part of the CFP event process. And we
were very pleased that it was chosen by those who bought the first batch of tickets.

This time we spoke about **Testing Ginormous JavaScript Apps**. With a codebase
consisting of 1679 JS (250k+ lines of code), 231 HTML templates and 386 CSS files
we believe we're in a good position to talk about the problems we've come up against
and how we've solved them, when building Ginormous JavaScript Apps.

This talk was also recorded and we'll share when it's ready. The [Testing Ginormous JavaScript
Apps - ScotlandJS](http://www.slideshare.net/leggetter/testing-ginormous-javascriptappsscotlandjs2014) slides are available on slideshare (**Featuring Dinosaurs!**).

## v0.8 Released

Last, but not least, we've [released v0.8](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases/tag/v0.8).

As part of the open sourcing process we took a branch of the code and removed any
internally focused functionality - anything that we believe will only be of benefit
to [Caplin Trader](http://www.caplin.com/caplin-trader)(CT) application development.
Any CT specific functionality has been moved out to be a [BRJS plugin](/docs/extend/).

Over the past few weeks the CT team have been looking at using BRJS again
so we've been helping them with any integration problems. This focus has resulted in
v0.8 containing mainly backwards compatibility fixes.

We have made some progress towards making it easier to [add libraries](/docs/concepts/libraries/)
to BladeRunnerJS applications, but there is still some work to be done there.

For v0.9 our main focus will be to add support for [Flat File Deployment](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/issues/18) so that BRJS apps
can easily be deployed to any hosting environment i.e. GitHub pages or any CDN.

If you've already tried out BladeRunnerJS and have some feedback or if you decide
to give it a try after reading this please [get in touch](/support/).
