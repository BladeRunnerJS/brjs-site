A **bladeset** is a collection of blades that share some common code. They can also share assets such as styles, HTML templates and images. This allows you to create logical groupings of blades that display information in a consistent way. For instance: you would use a bladeset to share the custom code for numerical formatting in a set of blades, or to house a common date-chooser configuration.
