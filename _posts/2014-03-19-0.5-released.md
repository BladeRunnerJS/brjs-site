The latest release of BRJS, v0.5, comes with new dependency analysis commands, further improvements towards supporting NPM package support, IE8 support and improved stability for running tests on Windows.

## New Dependency Analysis commands

Want to better understand why a class or other asset type is being bundled as a dependency? Or even just to understand the dependencies of your application in a tree graph? This one's for you!

#### Commands

```
* app-deps <app> [<aspect>] [-A|--all]
* workbench-deps <app> <bladeset> <blade>
* dep-insight <app> <require-path> [<aspect>] [-p|--prefix] [-a|--alias] [-A|--all]
```

#### Example output
```
$ ./brjs app-deps myApp

Aspect 'default' dependencies found:
    +--- 'default-aspect/index.html' (seed file)
    |    \--- 'myApp/Class1'
    |    |    +--- 'myApp/Class2'
    +--- 'resources/xml/config.xml' (seed file)
    |    \--- 'myApp/Class1' (*)

    (*) - dependencies omitted (listed previously)
```

For further details on these commands, see our wiki page for [debugging your application dependencies](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/wiki/Debugging-your-application-dependencies).

## Towards NPM package support

One of the core objectives when we started out with BRJS was to enable a nicer coding style. Support for Node.js style `require( 'MyThing' )`, `module.exports = MyThing` and `exports.MyThing = MyThing` was our initial goal. It only makes sense for us to also support Node.js style packages.

We don't plan to go as far as [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and enable support for core Node.js runtime packages, but we do want to support understanding NPM package and bundling dependencies based on the contents of `package.json`.

In this release we've... **TODO: what**

## IE8 Support

We've made changes to the entry point library for all BRJS applications. We call this `br-bootstrap`. This library now depends on a number of shims to support IE8 'out of the box'. These include [html5shiv](https://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/), [es5-shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim) and [normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) (v2.1.1).

If you don't want or need to support IE8 you can override the default dependencies on a per-app basis by... **TODO: how**

**still discussing if this is the best solutions**

## Improved stability of running tests on Windows
In our [previous v0.4 release](https://github.com/BladeRunnerJS/brjs/releases/tag/v0.4) we had a known issue related to a Java 7 bug that caused the JVM to crash on Windows due to a race condition when closing/cancelling File Watchers.

This bug is still [open](http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8029516) with Oracle at the moment, but in the interim we've got a temporary workaround which is to not `cancel()` or `close()` the File Watchers on Windows and let the process terminate them when it ends.
