# This page exists to prevent 404s as our legacy JS API docs linked to this page.

The dashboard is the GUI that is bundled with BladeRunnerJS. Most commands available in the [`BRJS CLI`](/docs/use/commandline/) are supported using the dashboard, including creating [Apps](/docs/concepts/apps/); [BladeSets](/docs/concepts/bladesets/) and [Blades](/docs/concepts/blades/).

The Dashboard is automatically hosted when `./brjs serve` is run and can be accessed by loading either `http://localhost:7070/` or `http://localhost:7070/dashboard/`.
