**BladeRunnerJS** (BRJS) is a developer toolkit and lightweight JavaScript framework developed by [Caplin Systems](http://www.caplin.com). It helps you structure, develop, build and deliver complex web applications consisting of very large JavaScript codebases and numerous components that are being developed by multiple teams within an organisation. It does this by following a number of workflows and software engineering principles.

## Open Sourcing

We're open sourcing BladeRunnerJS because, although there are a number of great workflow, developer toolkits and frameworks available (like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and [Mimosa](http://mimosajs.com/)), we've developed BRJS to meet the requirements specific to building a large JavaScript SDK and applications which are delivered to enterprise organistions.

BRJS has significantly improved the developer productivity for both us and our customers when developing, testing, building and deploying applications. We hope that by open sourcing BRJS it will be useful to others who are building similarly complex applications in, or for, complex organisations. We're also very interested to see if it is useful outside of these organisations, building different types of applications.

BladeRunnerJS is presently tightly coupled with the product we build with it. We're in the process of decoupling. As soon as that is complete the code will be available on github.

## More coming soon...

We're busy doing the work we need to do to open source it. But we'll share more information about why we created BRJS and the concepts it uses over time.
