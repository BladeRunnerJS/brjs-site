Internationalization (or i18n) support is built in to BladeRunnerJS. It allows any application developed to be customised to suit any locale. This includes translation of:

* text
* date formats
* number formatting
* parameterized translations

For detailed information see [Internationalizing your App](/docs/use/internationalization/).
