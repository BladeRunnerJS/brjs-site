### Contributor Licence Agreement

<pre class="cla">
In order to clarify the intellectual property position in relation to Contributions from any person or entity, Caplin Systems Limited ("Caplin") requires a Contributor Licence Agreement ("CLA"), indicating agreement to the licence terms below. This licence is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Caplin; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose. 

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future Contributions submitted to Caplin. Except for the licence granted herein to Caplin, and sub-licences granted by Caplin to recipients of software distributed by Caplin, you reserve all rights, titles, and interests in and to your Contributions.

1. Definitions

    1.1. "You" (or "your") shall mean the copyright owner (whether individual or corporate) or legal entity authorised by the copyright owner that is entering into this CLA. The entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise including but not limited to employment, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    2.2. "Contribution" shall mean any new work, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by you to Caplin for inclusion in any of the products owned or managed by Caplin (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Caplin or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Caplin for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by you as "Not a Contribution."

2. Grant of Licence 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this CLA, You hereby grant to Caplin a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable licence to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, adapt, develop, sub-license, and distribute your Contributions and derivative works. This licence extends to all copyright, database rights, design rights, trade and service marks or names, patents, or other intellectual property, any applications to register any of the foregoing and the right to apply for any of the foregoing, in each case in any jurisdiction. 

You hereby waive all moral rights (if any) in relation to your Contributions. 

3. You represent and warrant that you are legally entitled to grant the above licence. 

    3.1. If you are an individual, your employer(s) may have rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions from that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to Caplin, or that your employer has executed a separate CLA with Caplin.

    3.2. If you are a corporate entity ("Corporation"), including but not limited to a partnership or limited company: 

        3.2.1. The person executing this CLA on the Corporation’s behalf represents that he or she is authorised to execute the CLA on behalf of the Corporation; and

        3.2.2. you represent that each employee of the Corporation who may from time to time make or submit Contributions is authorised to make or submit Contributions on behalf of the Corporation.

4. You represent that each of your Contributions is your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party licence or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are aware and which are associated with any part of your Contributions.

5. You are not expected to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed with us in writing, You provide your Contributions on an as is basis without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied, including, without limitation, quality or fitness for a particular purpose. 

6. In submitting a Contribution you agree not to do anything likely to adversely affect Caplin’s business, including but not limited to submitting knowingly or deliberately defective content, viruses or other harmful components. 

7. Should you wish to submit work that is not your original creation, you may submit it to Caplin separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any licence or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and licence agreements) of which you are aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8. You agree to notify Caplin of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make any representations set out in this CLA inaccurate in any respect.
