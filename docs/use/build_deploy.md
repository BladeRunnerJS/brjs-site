BladeRunnerJS (BRJS) provides built-in support for building your application. It provides automatic versioning support and two forms of build output; static file and a packaged WAR file.

## Application Versioning

When an application is built, the location of assets is auto-generated to include a version string which is the timestamp at the point the build is executed.

When you build and deploy your application the `index.html` [aspect](/docs/concepts/aspects/) entry point will refer to the versioned assets (JS, CSS, HTML templates etc.).

If you build and deploy your application as a WAR, a filter is included to set caching headers. Note that `index.html` aspect files are not cached as they are the entry point to your application and will change on each build. The rest of the application assets will be cached.

However, if you build and deploy your application as static assets **you will need to ensure that `index.html` aspect files are not cached** by configuring your server appropriately.

## Building your App

The two forms of build output that BRJS supports are:

1. Static file build for deployment on any web server or CDN
2. WAR file build for deployment on servers like Tomcat and JBoss

The command for building application is:

```bash
./brjs build-app <app-name> [<target-dir>] [-w|--war]
```

Where the `app-name` is the name of the application you wish to build and `target-dir` is where you want the output of the build to go. The `-w` or `--war` command allows you to set the output to be built as a [WAR file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)).

### Build as Static Files

If you wish to deploy your application to any web server or a CDN then it's likely that you'll want to use the BRJS toolkit to build your assets into concatenated file bundles that can be served as static files.

For example, in the following example the app named `myapp` will be built to a directory `~/apps/myapp/`:

```bash
./brjs build-app myapp ~/apps
```

*Note: in the above example `~/apps` must exist*

The built application will consist of a directory for each locale, an `index.html` application entry point and a `v` directory containing another directory representing the timestamp version of the build e.g. `1403275456940` is `Fri Jun 20 2014 15:44:16 GMT+0100 (BST)`.

The structure of the contents of timestamp version directory is as follows:

* `css` - The bundled CSS with a file for each available theme
* `cssresource` - any resources referenced by the CSS e.g. images
* `html` - bundled HTML templates
* `i18n` - contianing a `.js` file for each supported application locate
* `js` - Various JavaScript bundles that can be generated by the [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/). By default only simple concatenation will occur.

### Build as WAR

If you are deploying to an environment that supports WAR file then BRJS provides support for building a deployable WAR. This is achieved using the `-w` flag:

```bash
./brjs build-app -w myapp ~/apps
```

*Note: in the above example `~/apps` must exist*

This will create a `myapp.war` file in `~/apps`. You can now deploy the `.war` file to your WAR supporting web server.
