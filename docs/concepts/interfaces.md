Interfaces are a well known concept in object-oriented programming. The core BRJS framework provides a mechanism to define and use Interfaces within a JavaScript application.

They are used by [services](/docs/concepts/services/), the [ServiceRegistry] and can also be used anywhere within a BRJS application that you wish to define a contract of interaction with an object.
