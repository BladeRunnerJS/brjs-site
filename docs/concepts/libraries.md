Libraries in BladeRunnerJS don't differ significantly from libraries in any other web application. They can contain the definition of useful functionality, UI components or [services](/docs/concepts/services).

Libraries can contain JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Images, Config files and other types of resources. The most common use case is probably to contain reusable JavaScript code such as services.
